Hello world. This site was built with semantic html5 and css3. This is my first published site through my web development journey. Little did I know about javascript when I build this site. After building the site, my journey will go through deep in learning javascript and React. Of course you have to know more about javascript and at least one frameworks in your life time as a front-end developer.
