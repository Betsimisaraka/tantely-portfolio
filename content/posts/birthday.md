This is a vanilla javascript `CRUD` app. I built this project to familiarize myself with javascript concepts. I think this was a fun project to play with because it covers most of the fundamental user interfaces `UI` that front-end developers need or at least, know. Given a figma design, I had to match the design which was a fantastic exercise for CSS.
