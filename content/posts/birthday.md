This is a Vanilla JavaScript CRUD app. I built this project to familiarize myself with javascript concepts. It was a fun project to hone my JavaScript and Front End knowledge... I followed a <a class='figma' href="https://www.figma.com/file/bb1Mie5R3mUhR77PtGG8bJ/Birthday-App?node-id=0%3A1">figma design</a> and it was also a fantastic CSS exercise.
