In MONTH, 2020, after a month and half of learning React I built this site to put into practice what I had learned. I believe the best way to learn is by doing - so this was the perfect opportunity to do just that.

The app displays a quiz that allows a user to select an option given four options. For each round, users are asked to guess a name of a country given the flag or the capital of a country. The goal, for users, in this app is to score as high as possible. I used react context, react hooks and styled-components.
