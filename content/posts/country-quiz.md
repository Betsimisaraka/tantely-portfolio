After learning one and half month of learning react I build this site to practice what I have just learned. I think it was worth building something after a hard work of learning the basic concepts of react. After this I will learn more about state management and advanced hooks because once you know them, that's where the power comes.

This app displays a list of countries. There is one question and four options for its round. I did this project to get myself round to react context, react hooks and styled-components.
