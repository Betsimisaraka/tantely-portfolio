After a month and half of learning react I build this site to practice what I have just learned because I think putting things into practice is the best way to learn. I think it was worth building something after a hard work of learning the basic concepts of react.

The app display a quiz that allows a user to select an option given four options. There is a question for each round and a question is to guess a name of a country is given a flag or a capital of the country. The goal, for the user, in this app is to score as high as possible. I did this project to get myself round to react context, react hooks and styled-components.
