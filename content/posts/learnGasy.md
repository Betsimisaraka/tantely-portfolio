This is a group project that we build. We want to practice our react native skills, so we wanted something that can be helpful. In this app you can learn both English and Malagasy. We thought it could be useful for both strangers that visit Madagascar and Malagasy people who are keen on learning english.

For now, It's only available for android, IOS will follow.
