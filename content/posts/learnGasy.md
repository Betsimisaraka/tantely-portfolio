This is a group project that we built. We wanted to practice our react native skills, so we wanted something that can be helpful. In this app you can learn both English and Malagasy. We thought it could be useful for both foreigners who want to learn malagasy and Malagasy people who are keen on learning English.

For now, It's only available for android, IOS will follow.
